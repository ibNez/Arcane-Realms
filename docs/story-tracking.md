# Story Tracking

This document records the evolving narrative for **Arcane Realms** and serves as a living reference while the game is developed.

## Base Storyline
- After the *War of the Ascendant*, only **Nexus Town** and a small surrounding wilderness remain.
- The cosmic **World Loom** rewove these lands and maintains an outer **Edge** in the form of **Aegis Walls**.
- When heroes reach an Aegis Wall, spectral **Watchers** appear. Defeating enough Watchers breaks the wall and starts a **24‑hour countdown** while the Loom stabilizes the next region.
- During this day, the Arcane Forge (developers) reviews the generated assets. When the barrier dissolves, new lands and tougher foes await.
- Each wall never reforms once broken, but further out another wall stands ready, leading toward major level milestones (20, 30, 40, etc.).
