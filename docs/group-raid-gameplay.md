# Group & Raid Gameplay

## Class Roles
| Class   | Strategic Function |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Warrior | Primary Tank; controls aggro and absorbs damage |
| Mage    | Ranged DPS; area damage and crowd control |
| Cleric  | Main Healer; keeps party alive |
| Rogue   | Melee DPS; burst damage and disruption |
| Paladin | Tank/Healer hybrid; defensive buffs |
| Archer  | Ranged DPS; kiting and area denial |

## Group Play
Small **groups** consist of 4â€“6 players and tackle dungeons and minor bosses. A typical setup includes one tank, one healer, and multiple DPS roles. Coordination focuses on:
- Managing enemy pulls and positioning.
- Combining crowd control effects.
- Sharing loot and quest objectives.

## Raid Play
**Raids** are large engagements of 12+ players designed for major encounters. Raid composition may require multiple tanks and healers to handle complex mechanics and heavy damage. Key features:
- Boss abilities that target multiple subgroups.
- Role assignments for adds, interrupt rotations, and phase transitions.
- Reward structures scaled for high difficulty.

## World Bosses
Roaming **world bosses** wander the open world and demand raid-level coordination to defeat. They feature massive health pools, devastating attacks, and server-wide announcements when engaged.

## Dungeons & Smaller Bosses
Procedurally generated dungeons and region bosses are balanced for standard groups. These encounters emphasize teamwork without the logistical overhead of raids.
