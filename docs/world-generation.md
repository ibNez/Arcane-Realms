# World Generation & Expansion System

## Overview
Arcane Realms features a **player-driven world generation system** where the game world expands dynamically based on player exploration. This document outlines the technical and design aspects of how the world grows, evolves, and maintains performance at scale.

## Generation Philosophy

### Player-Centric Design
- **Exploration-Driven**: The world only expands when players actively explore
- **Meaningful Discovery**: Each new area should offer unique content or progression opportunities
- **Collective Experience**: All players share the same persistent world, building a collective history
- **Emergent Narrative**: The world's story emerges from player actions and discoveries

## Technical Architecture

### World Segmentation
```
World
├── Regions (10km x 10km)
│   ├── Zones (1km x 1km)
│   │   ├── Cells (100m x 100m)
│   │   │   ├── Chunks (20m x 20m)
│   │   │   └── Points of Interest
│   │   └── Biome Boundaries
│   └── Regional Themes/Lore
└── Global World State
```

### Tile Scale & Seamless Tiling

- **Ground tile**: 1024 × 1024 image generated by Stable Diffusion
- **Grid scale**: 1 cell = 16 px = 5 ft
- **Tile coverage**: 64 × 64 cells → **320 ft per side**
- **Expanded zones**: arrange tiles in a 4 × 4 grid (16 tiles) to span ~1280 ft
- **Seamless edges**: every tile is generated with repeatable borders so any
  combination stitches without visible seams
- **Character scale**: sprites 32–48 px tall appear ~5–7 ft in world space

These tiles form the visual foundation for each **Cell (100 m / ~320 ft)** in the
segmentation above, allowing the system to stream only the imagery required for
the player’s immediate surroundings.

### Generation Pipeline
1. **Trigger Detection**: Player approaches world boundary
2. **Generation Queue**: Request enters rate-limited queue
3. **Seed Generation**: Deterministic seed based on coordinates + world state
4. **Content Generation**: 
   - Terrain generation
   - Biome assignment
   - POI placement
   - Enemy spawn configuration
   - Resource distribution
   - **Dynamic Asset Generation** (see Dynamic Environment System below)
5. **Validation**: Ensure connectivity and playability
6. **Integration**: Seamlessly connect to existing world
7. **Activation**: Make available for player exploration

#### Ground Tile Generation Steps
1. **Determine Tile Set**: Calculate which 1024 × 1024 tiles (and any 4 × 4 groups)
   are required based on player direction and world coordinates
2. **Prompt Assembly**: Build Stable Diffusion prompts using biome, history, and
   neighboring tile edges to ensure stylistic continuity
3. **Image Generation**: Request tiles with tiling enabled so borders repeat
   cleanly; multiple tiles can be generated in parallel
4. **Edge Validation**: Compare new tile edges against adjacent tiles and
   regenerate if seams or color shifts exceed thresholds
5. **Layer Composition**: Overlay roads, rivers, and POIs on top of the base
   ground tile while respecting collision maps
6. **Storage & Caching**: Persist generated tiles with metadata (seed, biome,
   neighbors) for reuse and rollback

## Dynamic Environment System

### AI-Powered Asset Generation
Arcane Realms features a **dynamic visual environment** where the world's appearance adapts to its biome, history, and current state through AI-generated imagery. Rather than using static, pre-made assets, the game employs **Stable Diffusion** to create contextually appropriate visuals that maintain gameplay functionality while providing infinite visual variety.

### Base Component Library
The system starts with a **foundational asset library** of core structural elements:

#### Architectural Components
- **Walls**: Stone walls, wooden walls, brick walls, metal barriers
- **Buildings**: Houses, shops, taverns, temples, towers, ruins
- **Infrastructure**: Bridges, roads, gates, fences, wells
- **Defensive**: Fortifications, watchtowers, ramparts, moats

#### Environmental Elements
- **Natural**: Trees, rocks, rivers, hills, caves, cliffs
- **Agricultural**: Farmland, fields, orchards, pastures, barns
- **Decorative**: Statues, fountains, gardens, monuments
- **Functional**: Crafting stations, storage, market stalls

### Contextual Asset Transformation

#### Biome-Based Adaptation
Each base component is dynamically modified based on the local biome and environmental conditions:

**Forest Biome Transformations:**
- Stone walls → Stone walls with moss, ivy, and climbing vines
- Houses → Log cabins with overgrown roofs and forest camouflage
- Roads → Dirt paths with exposed tree roots and fallen leaves
- Wells → Wooden wells surrounded by mushrooms and forest floor debris

**Desert Biome Transformations:**
- Stone walls → Sun-bleached sandstone with erosion patterns
- Houses → Adobe structures with sun-dried brick and cloth awnings
- Roads → Sandy paths with scattered stones and wind-carved patterns
- Wells → Ornate stone wells with brass fittings and shade structures

**Jungle Biome Transformations:**
- Stone walls → Ancient stone covered in thick vines and tropical vegetation
- Houses → Elevated structures on stilts with thatched roofs and hanging plants
- Roads → Wooden walkways and rope bridges through dense canopy
- Wells → Bamboo and stone structures with tropical flower decorations

**Arctic Biome Transformations:**
- Stone walls → Ice-covered stone with icicle formations
- Houses → Snow-laden cabins with smoking chimneys and fur-lined windows
- Roads → Frozen paths with snow drifts and ice patches
- Wells → Frozen wells with ice formations and winter decorations

#### Historical Layering
Assets further adapt based on the area's discovery history and player actions:

**Age and Wear:**
- Newly discovered areas: Clean, well-maintained appearance
- Established areas: Lived-in details, wear patterns, character marks
- Ancient areas: Weathering, patina, historical accumulation

**Player Impact:**
- High-traffic areas: Worn paths, established infrastructure
- Battle sites: Damage marks, repair patches, memorial elements
- Peaceful areas: Decorative flourishes, garden growth, comfort additions

### Technical Implementation

#### Asset Generation Pipeline
```
Base Asset + Context → Stable Diffusion → Generated Variant
    ↓              ↓                      ↓
Stone Wall    + Jungle Biome    → Vine-Covered Stone Wall
House         + Desert + Ancient → Weathered Adobe Ruins
Bridge        + Arctic + New     → Fresh Ice-Reinforced Bridge
```

#### Generation Parameters
```python
class AssetGenerationRequest:
    base_asset: BaseAssetType
    biome: BiomeType
    age_factor: float  # 0.0 (new) to 1.0 (ancient)
    weather_exposure: float  # Environmental wear
    player_traffic: int  # Usage level
    special_modifiers: List[str]  # Events, magic, etc.
    style_seed: str  # Consistency within region
```

#### Prompt Engineering
Each generation uses carefully crafted prompts that preserve functionality while adding context:

**Base Prompt Structure:**
```
[Base Component Description] in [Biome] environment, 
[Age Descriptor], [Traffic Level], [Special Conditions],
maintaining clear gameplay silhouette and function,
isometric game art style, detailed but clean
```

**Example Generated Prompts:**
- "Stone defensive wall in lush jungle environment, ancient and weathered, heavily overgrown with tropical vines and moss, small flowering plants, maintaining clear wall structure, isometric game art style"
- "Wooden farmhouse in arctic tundra, recently built, pristine snow coverage, icicles on eaves, smoke from chimney, maintaining clear building silhouette, isometric game art style"

### Asset Caching & Performance

#### Intelligent Caching System
- **Content Hash**: Each unique combination of base asset + context generates a deterministic hash
