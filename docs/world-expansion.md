# World Expansion Requirements

Arcane Realms features a world that grows outward whenever players reach its current edge. This document captures the gameplay and narrative requirements for that expansion system.

## Initial World Layout
- The launch world consists of **Nexus Town** (4×4 grid) surrounded on each side by a 4×4 wilderness.
- Four additional 4×4 wilderness blocks fill the corners, forming a **12×12** grid.
- Enemy level increases by **1** for each block away from the town; the outer ring of the starting world contains level‑4 mobs.

## Edge Barrier Event
- The perimeter of the known world is guarded by an **Aegis Wall** (a manifestation of the Edge).
- When players touch the boundary, a **Wall War** begins: spectral **Watchers** spawn at the wall to hold back expansion.
- Watcher spawn rate accelerates as their numbers fall, requiring sustained, server‑wide effort.
- Players must defeat a global kill threshold to destabilize the wall.
- Once the threshold is met, the wall drops and a **24‑hour countdown** begins before the new land opens.

## Asset Generation and Review
- The moment the Wall War triggers, the next region’s assets are generated and stored in asset storage.
- Assets remain locked for **one real‑world day** to allow the development team (the “Arcane Forge”) to review content for quality and safety.
- After the countdown ends, reviewed assets are promoted and the new territory becomes explorable.

## Rewards
- Watchers at the wall drop the **best loot for the current level bracket**.
- Players present when the wall collapses earn **Vanguard rewards** (e.g., titles, cosmetic items, treasure caches).
- Once a wall is broken it never reforms; the region stays open permanently with standard mob spawns.

## Growth Pace
- Higher‑level regions take players longer to reach, naturally spacing out expansions.
- Expansion cadence slows over time, giving the team more opportunity to review large, complex regions.
